# Simple Assembler I wish to study so I can compile assembly to my FUTURE 8-bit custom computer.


# Goals:
Move code from C++ to C or a similar language
Use a linker to work with a high-level language like:  Nim, Go(lang), (Common) Lisp (experimentally), Java-like language (non-JVM, experimentally), Haskell or C ( :D )
